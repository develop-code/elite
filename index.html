                       <li><strong>Program Components and Methodology - </strong>
                     All the programs normally include a component from the most reliable and international sources.
                     ELITE recognizes that the participants who take part in our language program are experts in their fields, and that youth participants also bring a great deal of knowledge. We see our role as exposing them not only to new knowledge but also to widely different ideas, situations, and people.  ELITE sessions stimulate thought and discussion, so that participants may build on their own knowledge and understanding. 
                     ELITE’s training methods include lectures, small group assignments, book studies, group discussions, workshops, writing assignments, participant research and presentations. ELITE staffs guide participants in reflecting on their own experiences and developing feasible and meaningful action plans to apply newly acquired knowledge and skills to their own place of work or study.<br/>

                    <li><strong>Commitment to Diversity - </strong>
                     Diversity is central to ELITE programming. We strive to include approximately equal numbers of men and women (or boys and girls) in each program, and our groups visit diverse communities including rural farming areas, suburbs, small cities, and major metropolises to persuade them for being educated.<br/>
                    </li>
                  <li><strong>Languages -</strong>
                     Programs are conducted in the participants' first or second language, or through interpretation. ELITE has provided programs in English, French, Russian, Turkish, German, Chinese, Spanish,Dari, and Pashto. We have also provided sessions through interpretation if needed.<br/>

                     One of the biggest impacts of Elite institute language programs is the positive change. Because this change is tied to a deeper understanding of the commonalities of different people, and to an optimism that we can work together to improve in some way the lives of those in all our communities.
                     Action plan, mentioned above, are another good example of post-program impact. These strategies are developed during most Elite programs, and implemented by participants on their return to the society.This means that they must be fueled by motivated and well-prepared.

                     <li><strong>Logistics -</strong>
                      ELITE manages all aspects of every program from the time participants arrive at the end of the program.
                      Training sessions take place at ELITE’ straining centre in the opposite street of Kandahari Masjed Kart-e-Char Kabul Afghanistan as well as the training sessions could take place to offices, and organizations upon request that during the program all the needed materials are arranged by ELITE institute.<br/>

                    <li><strong> Elite helps set this dynamic in motion by - </strong>
                     a) selecting, when charged with this task, participants with a strong desire to extend themselves to introduce positive changes into their workplaces or communities, <br/>
                     b) providing learning experiences that recognize and expand participants' competencies and knowledge base, <br/>
                     c) providing consistent guidance in plan development, and  <br/>
                     d) providing unflagging support and encouragement – by Elite staff. <br/>
                     
                       In addition to changed perspectives and action plan, the most significant follow-on activities result from the relationships built through the intensive and integrated programming that Elite plans and implements.  Group members often form friendships and strong professional bonds with one another.  These connections not only afford them personal fulfillment, but also motivate, inform, and enhance future professional, academic, or community projects.

                                  <p align=""><b>Express Care </b><BR/>
                                    Expressing care is the foundation of family strengths and relationships. When we express care to our children, we show them that we like them and want the best for them. We show our kids that we care by how we listen, show warmth, invest time and energy, and are someone they can count on.
                                    <BR/><b>Provide Support </b><BR/>
                                    An important way families stick together is helping each other in practical ways to stay on track to learn, grow, complete tasks, and achieve goals
                                    <BR/><b>Challenge Growth </b><BR/>
                                    We all need nudges that push us to work hard on achieving our goals. We challenge our kids to grow by pushing them beyond what’s comfortable, raising questions, and testing their abilities in ways that are demanding, stimulating, and motivating. We also help them keep them heading in a positive direction by setting appropriate limits.
                                    <BR/><b>Expand Possibilities </b><BR/>
                                    We help each other grow in our families when we look beyond what we already know to see things beyond today that can open new possibilities in the future. This involves trying new things, going new places, and meeting new people
                                    <BR/><b>Share Power </b><BR/>
                                    Relationships involve a give and take. Our kids learn and grow when they have a voice in the family and are part of making decisions that affect them. How we share power-how that changes as our kids grow up-prepares them to be responsible, contributing adults.
                                    <BR/><b>Learning Language</b><BR/>
                                    Elite institute has pursued all the aspects since it has been established to strength and motivate the children in learning English language. Our dedicated teachers follow up the family & friends system which has been beautifully designed for children and have perfect result. In this system the classes are designed in a very friendly, loving, and full of fun which help the children to be interested in learning. Our pervious classes’ students passed the system very satisfactorily.

These are all skills which will be needed to carry out your academic studies and the test is used by institutions to ensure students are able to proceed and succeed in their chosen course in a country where the curriculum is taught in English.
                                    The TOEFL test is usually conducted in the form of an online test, but if the test center does not have an internet connection then a paper-based test can be offered.
                                    <BR/><b>Who needs to take a TOEFL test?</b><BR/>
                                    The TOEFL test has been taken by over 27 million people worldwide to ensure their English ability is adequate. The test is often taken by students who are planning to study at a university abroad and scholarship candidates, along with students and workers who are applying for visas and English-language learners tracking their English progress. Keep an eye out on the requirements for university courses, as it will be stated there whether you are required to take the TOEFL and the minimum grade required to apply for the course.<BR/>
                                    <BR/><b>Why take a TOEFL test?</b><BR/>
                                    Educational institutions and governmental agencies in over 130 countries accept TOEFL scores when considering applications for certain positions or courses. As an admission requirement, you may find that some courses require a minimum TOEFL score which will allow you to proceed onto the course alongside the regular course requirements. Minimum score requirements can range between 61 and 100 depending on the institution and course.
                                    The result you receive in your TOEFL test will only be valid for two years, after those two years they are no longer recorded, so if you’re looking to apply to study abroad after this time, you will have to sit the test again. It is important to ensure you take the test in time for your application if the result is part of the requirements; if you are only studying a course which lasts a year the same TOEFL results could be used to improve your opportunities for working in a foreign country also.
                                    If it is part of the requirements for your admission then it is important to research in more depth and be prepared for the different elements of the test. Here are the different elements of each test:
                                    <BR/><b>Internet test (TOEFL iBT)</b><BR/>
                                    – A reading section of between 60-100 minutes which involves reading 3-5 passages, containing 12-14 question in each.<BR/>
                                    – A listening section of between 60-90 minutes which involves 6-9 passages, containing 5-6 questions in each.<BR/>
                                    – A speaking section which lasts 20 minutes and involves 6 spoken tasks.<BR/>
                                    – A writing section which last 50 minutes and involves 2 tasks which need completion.
                                    <BR/><b>Paper-based test (TOEFL PBT)</b><BR/>
                                    – A listening section of between 30-40 minutes consisting of 3 parts<BR/>
                                    – A structure and written expression section lasting 25 minutes which includes 15 exercises of sentence completion and 25 
									<BR/><b>examples for error identification</b><BR/>
                                    – A reading section which lasts 50 minutes and includes answering 50 questions about passages.<BR/>
                                    – A writing section which lasts 30 minutes, which involves one written essay containing around 250-300 words.<BR/>
                                    The main difference between the two formats is the spoken section of the test which is replaced by structure and written expressions section in the paper-based test.<BR/>
                                    It is important to check the admission requirements for your chosen university or institution to see if TOEFL results are required for entry prior to apply. Once you have your TOEFL results, remember that a record of them only lasts for 2 years, so make the most of the hard work and money you put into it and improve your future prospects.

                                  <p align="justify"> <B>The first reason for learning the Russian language? </B></BR>

More than 260 million people around the world speak it. It is not only the official language of Russian, but also of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Additionally, it is spoken in Israel, the Balkans, Ukraine, Armenia and the USA. At times, it has been considered as the most spoken language in Europe, and, according to the language catalog, Russian is the 8th most spoken language in the world.</BR></BR>

Being a Slavic language, the Russian language shares a lot of similarities with languages such as Polish, Ukrainian, Bulgarian and Czech. When it comes to the countries which were part of the old Soviet Union, it is estimated that those who were in their twenties after the dissolution of the USSR still know some Russian. It is estimated that there are around 850.000 speakers of the language in the U.S. alone.</BR></BR>

Since 2000, Russia has been in the process of positioning itself as a major economic force. The birth of the new Russian middle class has led many to travel abroad, making a significant mark in the global tourism industry. If you work in tourism, knowing how to speak Russian is definitely something to put on your CV.</BR> </BR>

<B>Learning Russian Allows You to Learn Something New, Useful and Different</B></BR>
Learning Russian makes you understand useful concepts for studying other languages, too. Learning Russian will completely change the way you tackle learning other languages and your surroundings. If you’re a university student or are in college, now is the time to take the decision to learn Russian.</BR> </BR>

<B>Learn Russian Because You Want to!</B></BR>
This is the last reason for learning Russian, but probably the most important one. If you’ve read this far, it’s because learning Russian is something you want to do. The number of people who speak a certain language, or the work opportunities a language offers can’t be your only motivation. Passion and interest are the most important assets you can have for learning a language. Especially a difficult language to learn like Russian. If you’d love to learn Russian, if you get emotional every time you listen to Russian music, if your significant other is Russian, or if you’ve always dreamed of visiting Moscow, you already have the perfect reason for learning Russian. This will motivate you to learn the language more than any other reason ever could. So in this regard Elite institute will help you to learn it quickly, easily and perfectly.

                          <p>I started to study in the ELITE in October and in a few months I went from an elementary level to an intermediate level, thanks to the skill of the teachers who follow you step by step in your growth. Here at the Elite I found not only professionalism and reliability, but also lots of love, it’s like belonging to a big family!  ELITE Institute not only offers language courses in more effective and efficient but offers every week many social activities.  is a learning centre that I recommend to anyone who wants to improve in a short time and at a reasonable price?</p>

                          <p>What I liked about the experience in Elite 
                              1) Central location the centre is located 3 mins walking distance from main Road .
                              2) Prices are amazingly low for a central location and good quality of teaching.
                              3) All tutors are good.
                              4) Good administration team – you feel like at home.
                              5) Many events and activities for students.
                              I can recommend this place for those who would like to:
                              -Study English in the heart of Kabul with professional tutors.
